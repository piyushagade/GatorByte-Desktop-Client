# Cereal - A modern serial monitor
Ever had a thought why all available serial monitoring tools are stuck in the past? I did too, and hence developed this app. Cereal is not just a simple serial monitor, but comes loaded with numerous features that will make your life a lot easier.

## Features
1. Serial Monitor, of course!
2. Multiple windows to monitor multiple devices. 
3. Follow a device, so that you don't have to manually open the port.
4. Custom hooks. Cereal will take actions when a specified string is printed on the serial monitor. 
5. See serial data across the globe with Cereal's web interface on a different computer/smartphone. Also, send commands from anywhere.
6. Quickly connect the last connected device so that you don't have to wade through the huge list of available devices.
And many more...
